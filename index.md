PostgreSQL Dashboard is simple monitoring tool that provides a live activity report of a PostgreSQL instance.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daamien/pgDashboard/master/public/pgdashboard.screenshot2.png)

It is designed to be displayed on a large screen in a monitoring room or an open space office.
The current dashboard is currently composed of 5 widgets :

* **General Info** : Version, number of host databases, etc. 
* **Hit Ratio** : The % of data found in cache
* **Buffers** : The number of new buffers allocated
* **Queries** : The number of active queries currently running of the instance
* **Twitter** : A glimpse of the #PostgreSQL feed

Adding a new job should be fairly easy. this tool is design so that you can write a custom widget to display stats you find relevant or build a dynamic graph on some "business logic" valuation.

The layout is also entirely flexible. You can easily drag'n'drop any widget to put it wherever you want on the screen. And HTML code of the dashboard can be modified for specific needs, such as specific screen dimensions.

## Quick Start

If you already have installed a Ruby environnement, simply type:

```
  git clone https://github.com/daamien/PostgreSQL-Dashboard.git
  cd PostgreSQL-Dashboard
  bundle
  mv config_postgresql.rb.example config_postgresql.rb
  vi config_postgresql.rb
  dashing start
```

Now go to [http://localhost:3030]() and have fun!

## Requirements

PostgreSQL Dashboard is based on Dashing, a very nice dashboard framework.
Dashing itself is based on Sinatra, a very nice Ruby web framework.

Basically to run this tool, you will need:
 
* PostgreSQL 9.0.x or later
* Ruby 1.9.x or later
* Sinatara 1.4.x or later
* Dashing 1.3.x or later

## Security

__You need to be careful about the security of your PostgreSQL server when installing this tool .__

Therefore I **strongly** recommend the following precautions :

* [Read the Great PostgreSQL Documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)
* Check your ``pg_hba.conf`` file
* Do not allow users to access PostgreSQL Dashboard from the Internet
* Do not use a superuser in the config_postgresql.rb file
