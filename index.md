## What is a Business Dashboard tool and how to it works

A business dashboard builder is a powerful drag-and-drop tool which doesnâ€™t require any programming skill to create a coplex business dashboard. The business dashboad builder t tracks and simplifies complex data query and gives quick insight of business performance to the business users.

# Why do companies use business dashboards?

The main reason for using a business dashboard is to provide a comprehensive view of business performance. A business dashboard summarizes different sections of business with easy-to-understand in a graphical layout.

It is designed to be displayed on a large screen in a monitoring room or an open space office.

The current dashboard is currently composed of 5 widgets :

* **General Info** : Version, number of host databases, etc. 
* **Hit Ratio** : The % of data found in cache
* **Buffers** : The number of new buffers allocated
* **Queries** : The number of active queries currently running of the instance
* **Twitter** : A glimpse of the #PostgreSQL feed

Adding a new job should be fairly easy. this tool is design so that you can write a custom widget to display stats you find relevant or build a dynamic graph on some "business logic" valuation.

The layout is also entirely flexible. You can easily drag'n'drop any widget to put it wherever you want on the screen. And HTML code of the dashboard can be modified for specific needs, such as specific screen dimensions.

## Quick Start

If you already have installed a Ruby environnement, simply type:

__You need to be careful about the security of your PostgreSQL server when installing this tool .__

Therefore I **strongly** recommend the following precautions :

* [Read the Great PostgreSQL Documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)
* Check your ``pg_hba.conf`` file
* Do not allow users to access PostgreSQL Dashboard from the Internet
* Do not use a superuser in the config_postgresql.rb file
